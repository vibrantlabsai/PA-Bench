Over the past four weeks our engineering team has completed the integration prototype with two enterprise customers and validated the primary performance metrics (latency, throughput and stability) that we discussed during our December call. We are ready to move forward with a structured pilot program and a first draft of the commercial proposal.\n\nKey deliverables proposed for the pilot:\n- Phase 1 (4 weeks): Environment setup, baseline performance validation, and customer onboarding checklist.\n- Phase 2 (8 weeks): Feature enablement, iterative tuning, and operational handover.\n- Final deliverable: Post-pilot performance report, recommended production runbook, and proposed commercial terms.\n\nI have attached a written proposal and a preliminary timeline for your review. Could we schedule a 60-minute meeting the week of January 12 to review the proposal, discuss the draft commercial terms, and align on success metrics? Our preferred slot is Tuesday, January 13 at 15:00, but we are flexible and can accommodate an alternate time if that works better for you. Proposed agenda: 1) Pilot scope and deliverables, 2) Commercial and payment milestones, 3) Data security and compliance, 4) Next steps and schedule.\n\nPlease let me know your availability and any additional materials you would like in advance of the meeting.\n\nKind regards,\n\nAlan Cooper\nFounder & CEO\nHelixGrid\nalan@helixgrid.com",

A few follow-up items we would like clarified in advance or covered early in the meeting:\n\n1) Payment milestone: We would prefer an adjusted schedule with 30% on Phase 1 completion, 50% on Phase 2 mid-point, and 20% on final acceptance to better align cashflow with delivery risk. Please confirm whether HelixGrid can accommodate that change or propose alternatives.\n\n2) Data security and compliance: Please provide a short summary (2\u20133 paragraphs) of your current compliance posture and any controls in place for customer data separation, encryption (in transit and at rest), and access controls. If SOC 2 is in progress, an expected completion date would be helpful.\n\n3) Product demo access: For our technical diligence, can you provide a time-limited demo account or sandbox access for our engineers to test integration flows prior to the meeting? If so, please include the access method and any usage constraints.\n\n4) IP and licensing: The draft term sheet states HelixGrid retains product IP with a customer license. Please confirm the scope of the license (perpetual, term-based, restricted to pilot vs. production) so we can review with our legal team.\n\nIf possible, can we schedule a short 30-minute pre-call on January 13 at 14:30 to run through the technical access and make sure our teams are set for the 15:00 discussion? Otherwise we will plan to address these items at the start of the meeting.\n\nRegards,\n\nMarcus Elliott\nGeneral Partner\nNorthBridge Capital\nmarcus@northbridgecap.vc",

We will update the draft term sheet to reflect this schedule and circulate the revised version prior to the pre-call.\n\n2) Data security and compliance: Current posture summary:\n- Controls: Role-based access controls, multi-factor authentication for admin access, and segmented customer environments to ensure logical separation.\n- Encryption: TLS 1.2+ for data in transit and AES-256 for data at rest. Keys are managed via a customer-isolated key management service for production environments.\n- Compliance: SOC 2 Type II readiness activities are underway with an expected completion date in Q2 2026. We maintain documented data handling and incident response procedures and can provide summaries or policy extracts as required.\n\n3) Product demo access: We will provide a time-limited sandbox account for your engineers with API credentials and a sample dataset. Access details:\n- URL: https://demo.helixgrid.com (credential to be shared securely)\n- Account duration: 14 days (extendable on request)\n- Support: A HelixGrid engineer will be available during the pre-call to assist with connectivity and sample tests.\n\n4) IP and licensing: For the pilot, the customer license is term-based and limited to the pilot scope; production deployment terms (perpetual vs. subscription) are negotiable and will be explicitly defined in the production agreement. HelixGrid retains core product IP while granting a license necessary for customer operation under the agreed terms.\n\nI will send the sandbox credentials and the updated term sheet by 12:00 UTC today so your team can begin the technical review.

Our intent is to evaluate a targeted optimization that reduces latency and egress costs while maintaining your current reliability SLAs.\n\nHigh-level proposal:\n- 8-week pilot led by HelixGrid engineering working closely with AeroLogix Cloud & Infrastructure.\n- Deliverables: architecture review, optimized deployment artifacts, integration guide, and a performance report with KPI comparisons.\n- Success criteria: 20% reduction in median end-to-end ingestion latency and measurable egress cost improvement within the pilot window.\n\nWould AeroLogix be open to a short introductory meeting next week to review scope, team allocation, and a proposed timeline? I am available the week of Jan 12\u201316 and can adjust to a time that suits your calendar.\n\nIf you prefer, we can circulate a one-page scope and a draft NDA in advance.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAlan Cooper\nFounder & CEO\nHelixGrid\nalan@helixgrid.com",

Highlights included:\n- Pricing vs. exclusivity: Meridian is pushing for a north-of-market introductory discount tied to a 12-month exclusivity window; counterproposal is a phased discount tied to user thresholds.\n- Integration timeline: 8\u201310 weeks for MVP integration with two dedicated sprints from their side; main dependency is API authentication flow.\n\nAction items before the meeting (owner \u2014 due):\n- Nadia: circulate pre-read and data room link (today EOD)\n- Lena: short integration risk note + mitigation (Mon Jan 12)\n- Marco: highlight three legal points and preferred contract windows (Mon Jan 12)\n\nIf you want me to add anything to the pre-read or shift the order of agenda items, tell me and I\u2019ll update the invite.\n\nThanks \u2014 I\u2019ll make sure the doc is crisp and ready for review.\n\nBest,\nNadia",

Load test results are within tolerance but we have one storage scaling issue to resolve.\n- Integrations: Payment gateway and SSO integrations are functional in staging; a compliance sign-off is pending for data residency rules in two markets.\n- Staffing: Hiring for 2 senior SRE roles is still open; that could affect our post-launch support window if not filled by late Jan.\n\nHigh-priority dependencies:\n- Legal: data residency confirmation for JP and AU (impact: possible configuration changes)\n- Vendor: storage provider capacity confirmation (impact: scalability and cost)\n\nProposed 30-min windows (all APAC local times; I can join otherwise):\n- 2026-01-07 08:00\n- 2026-01-08 14:00\n- 2026-01-09 10:00\n\nI will prepare a short pre-read (1 page status + risk register) and circulate it before the meeting.

If that works for you, I\u2019ll block it.\n\n2) Owners & deadlines (proposed)\n- Enablement deck: Priya (draft due Jan 12 EOD, final by Jan 13)\n- Technical roadmap slide: Marco (update due Jan 11 EOD)\n- Resource list (headcount + contractors): I\u2019ll compile (initial list due Jan 9 EOD)\n\n3) Pre-alignment\n- I can do a 30-min pre-alignment on Jan 9. Proposed time: Jan 9 at 10:00 UTC. We can walk the draft owners through the asks and dependencies.\n\nProposed agenda for the kickoff (60 min):\n- 5 min: Objectives and success metrics\n- 20 min: Enablement strategy & key deliverables\n- 15 min: Tech roadmap & customer impact\n- 10 min: Resourcing and hiring priorities\n- 10 min: Action items and owners\n\nI\u2019ll start a shared doc with the deliverable outlines and owners and add access for you. If Jan 14 at 15:00 UTC works, I\u2019ll send a calendar invite and add the pre-alignment for Jan 9 at 10:00 UTC.\n\nOne question: who from the Exec team do you want on the kickoff besides us?

As we move into Q1 planning for the Middle East rollout, I\u2019d like to schedule a short alignment call next week to confirm timelines, outstanding regional dependencies, and the comms plan.\n\nCould you confirm availability for a 60-minute meeting on either:\n- Tue, 2026-01-12 at 10:00 UTC\n- Wed, 2026-01-13 at 14:00 UTC\n\nFor the meeting, please include product, comms, and legal as needed. If you can share the latest deck and the high-level timeline before the call, that will let the country leads review and prepare questions.\n\nPrimary items I want on the agenda:\n- Final rollout timeline and milestones\n- Local pricing/approvals (UAE, KSA, others)\n- Translations and localized assets\n- Support coverage and escalation path\n\nLet me know which time works and whether you can send the materials by Monday, 2026-01-12.\n\nThanks \u2014 looking forward to aligning.\n\nBest,\nFatima",

I want to cover the migration pilot status, the Data API rollout timeline, and any cross-team risks that might affect our delivery. Ideally this would include a short demo and a one-page status summary.\n\nCan you share a brief update on where the migration pilot stands and whether the API work will be ready for staging by mid-January? Also please send a list of any stakeholders you want included in the invite (engineering leads, product, infra).\n\nProposed slots: Tue Jan 13 10:00\u201311:00 or Wed Jan 14 15:00\u201316:00. Let me know which works for you or propose alternatives.\n\nThanks,\nAlan",

I can cover the migration pilot and the Data API status in the same meeting.\n\nQuick status:\n- Migration pilot: On track. Pilot environment stability looks good; we're running smoke tests now. Target to complete pilot validation by EOD Jan 20, with a recommended cutover plan ready by Jan 22.\n- Data API: Core endpoints are functionally complete; we need one additional week of integration testing and a final security review. Current target for staging readiness is Jan 19.\n\nBlockers to note: infra needs to finish the DB failover verification (scheduled for Jan 18) before we can sign off migration risk. Also one of the backend engineers (Ravi) is on leave Jan 14\u201316 which tightens our test window.\n\nProposed agenda for Tue Jan 13, 10:00\u201311:00:\n1) 10 min \u2014 Goals and success criteria for Q1\n2) 20 min \u2014 Migration pilot demo + findings\n3) 15 min \u2014 Data API status and risks\n4) 10 min \u2014 Resource needs and next steps\n5) 5 min \u2014 Actions and owners\n\nI'll prepare a 6\u20138 slide deck and a 5-minute demo. I'll share materials by end of day Jan 12. Please let me know which stakeholders you'd like on the invite.\n\nRegards,\nPriya",

Highlights:\n- Migration pilot: Stability metrics look good (95% pass on smoke tests). Outstanding item: DB failover verification with infra on Jan 18 \u2014 if that passes we can proceed with the recommended timeline; if not we should shift cutover by one sprint.\n- Data API: End-to-end integration tests are 85% complete; remaining auth edge cases should be resolved by Jan 16 assuming no new regressions.\n- Resource note: Ravi is out Jan 14\u201316; I propose temporarily reallocating one senior engineer (Maya suggested Carmen) to help with the last round of tests.\n\nSlides to call out during the meeting:\n- Slide 3: Pilot health and go/no-go criteria\n- Slide 5: API rollout timeline and remaining test items\n- Slide 7: Resource ask \u2014 0.5 FTE for two weeks to cover Ravi's window\n\nIf you have 20 minutes before the meeting, I can do a quick dry run this afternoon (available 17:00\u201317:30). Otherwise I\u2019ll see you at 10:00 tomorrow.\n\nThanks,\nPriya",

The diligence team has completed the commercial diligence and we have a near-final financial model. Key takeaways:\n\n- Revenue projections look achievable but sensitive to 2027 service rollout\n- Gross margin assumptions need validation from ops (we flagged two line items)\n- Potential regulatory items in EU market \u2014 legal is running a focused review\n\nI'd like to schedule a 45-minute sync next week to run through the diligence highlights, the updated model, and decision points (go/no-go, valuation range, process next steps). I can send a one-page pre-read plus the model.\n\nAvailability I have open: Tue 2026-01-13 14:00\u201316:00 UTC, Wed 2026-01-14 09:00\u201311:00 UTC, or Thu 2026-01-15 10:00\u201312:00 UTC.

Proposed times: Jan 12 at 10:00 or Jan 13 at 15:00 (30\u201345 minutes). Agenda I\u2019m thinking: review baseline metrics, agree top 3 workstreams, assign owners, and set milestones to deliver a one-page roadmap by Jan 23.\n\nCan you confirm which time works for you and whether you want any exec-level objectives included up front?

Next two integrations scheduled for Jan 20 and Feb 3.\n- Infra blocker: Provisioning queue backlogged; Platform team estimates a 7\u201310 business day delay unless we prioritize. Proposed mitigation: short-term allocation of an infra engineer from Platform (1\u20132 weeks) and parallel automation of provisioning steps.\n- Contractor ask: UX engineer (focus on onboarding flow) and SDK support specialist (triage + docs). Each expected to deliver measurable lift in 6\u20138 weeks; I included cost estimates and onboarding plan in the doc.\n\nAttendee list: Alan, Noah, Maya (Product), Daniel (Platform). I'd also suggest inviting Priya from Security for a 10-minute check on the SDK release checklist \u2014 optional unless you want her there for the full meeting.\n\nI will circulate the meeting invite for Jan 14 14:00 and attach the pre-read.

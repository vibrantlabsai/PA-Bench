Over the past four weeks our engineering team has completed the integration prototype with two enterprise customers and validated the primary performance metrics (latency, throughput and stability) that we discussed during our December call. We are ready to move forward with a structured pilot program and a first draft of the commercial proposal.\n\nKey deliverables proposed for the pilot:\n- Phase 1 (4 weeks): Environment setup, baseline performance validation, and customer onboarding checklist.\n- Phase 2 (8 weeks): Feature enablement, iterative tuning, and operational handover.\n- Final deliverable: Post-pilot performance report, recommended production runbook, and proposed commercial terms.\n\nI have attached a written proposal and a preliminary timeline for your review. Could we schedule a 60-minute meeting the week of January 12 to review the proposal, discuss the draft commercial terms, and align on success metrics? Our preferred slot is Tuesday, January 13 at 15:00, but we are flexible and can accommodate an alternate time if that works better for you.

If that works for you, I\u2019ll block it.\n\n2) Owners & deadlines (proposed)\n- Enablement deck: Priya (draft due Jan 12 EOD, final by Jan 13)\n- Technical roadmap slide: Marco (update due Jan 11 EOD)\n- Resource list (headcount + contractors): I\u2019ll compile (initial list due Jan 9 EOD)\n\n3) Pre-alignment\n- I can do a 30-min pre-alignment on Jan 9. Proposed time: Jan 9 at 10:00 UTC. We can walk the draft owners through the asks and dependencies.\n\nProposed agenda for the kickoff (60 min):\n- 5 min: Objectives and success metrics\n- 20 min: Enablement strategy & key deliverables\n- 15 min: Tech roadmap & customer impact\n- 10 min: Resourcing and hiring priorities\n- 10 min: Action items and owners\n\nI\u2019ll start a shared doc with the deliverable outlines and owners and add access for you. If Jan 14 at 15:00 UTC works, I\u2019ll send a calendar invite and add the pre-alignment for Jan 9 at 10:00 UTC.\n\nOne question: who from the Exec team do you want on the kickoff besides us?

I can cover the migration pilot and the Data API status in the same meeting.\n\nQuick status:\n- Migration pilot: On track. Pilot environment stability looks good; we're running smoke tests now. Target to complete pilot validation by EOD Jan 20, with a recommended cutover plan ready by Jan 22.\n- Data API: Core endpoints are functionally complete; we need one additional week of integration testing and a final security review. Current target for staging readiness is Jan 19.\n\nBlockers to note: infra needs to finish the DB failover verification (scheduled for Jan 18) before we can sign off migration risk. Also one of the backend engineers (Ravi) is on leave Jan 14\u201316 which tightens our test window.\n\nProposed agenda for Tue Jan 13, 10:00\u201311:00:\n1) 10 min \u2014 Goals and success criteria for Q1\n2) 20 min \u2014 Migration pilot demo + findings\n3) 15 min \u2014 Data API status and risks\n4) 10 min \u2014 Resource needs and next steps\n5) 5 min \u2014 Actions and owners\n\nI'll prepare a 6\u20138 slide deck and a 5-minute demo.
